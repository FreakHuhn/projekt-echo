Project Echo
Project Echo is a Discord bot powered by AI (GPT), built with modular skills and a growing memory.
The main goal of this project is not the final product, but to document my personal drive, learning efforts, and motivation to transition into a new professional field – despite health-related challenges.

Transparency
About 95% of the source code was generated by ChatGPT / OpenAI through a co-pilot-like dialogue.

I personally:

Provided most of the project structure, design goals, and skill requirements

Wrote or revised many code comments and behavioral definitions

Questioned, documented, and reflected on the process throughout

Tracked my learning progress over the development timeline

Gave targeted corrections and structure-related feedback, such as memory handling and user interaction logic

Why I’m Doing This
This project isn’t just software – it’s also a form of therapy.
I’m proving to myself that I can still learn, think deeply, and stick with something, despite my limits.

If you're a developer, mentor, or potential employer reading this:
This is my entry point. My effort. I will establish myself in this profession – preferably with your help.
