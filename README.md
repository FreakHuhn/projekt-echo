Project Echo is a Discord bot powered by AI (GPT), built with modular skills and a growing memory.
The main goal of this project is not the final product, but to document my personal drive, learning efforts, and motivation to transition into a new professional field – despite health-related challenges.
Before this, I had only minimal experience with async Python and structured memory. Through Echo, I learned to manage session states, error handling, and dynamic prompt construction.

This repository is a public learning and development project. It shows:

How I manage a complex software project using structured tools and AI assistance

How I work with agile development methods, technical planning, and error analysis

That I can consistently structure, track, and manage a project over multiple weeks

About the Project

Project Echo includes:

A text-based Discord bot

GPT-based conversational logic

Skills like !echo, !tip, !gamequiz, !invite

A memory system to track user data, commands, and conversations

Planned voice integration via Whisper / ElevenLabs (optional)

Transparency

About 95% of the source code was generated by ChatGPT / OpenAI through a co-pilot-like dialogue.

I personally:

Provided most of the project structure, design goals, and skill requirements

Wrote or revised many code comments and behavioral definitions

Questioned, documented, and reflected on the process throughout

Tracked my learning progress over the development timeline

Gave targeted corrections and structure-related feedback, such as memory handling and user interaction logic

Why I’m Doing This

This project is more than code – it’s proof that I can learn, adapt, and build something meaningful.  
Despite health-related limitations, I’ve created a working AI-based system from scratch, documented the process, and kept pushing forward.

If you're a developer, mentor, or employer: This is my first step.  
I’m not looking for shortcuts – I’m looking for opportunities to grow. Let’s talk.

Update 02.05.2025: Development Paused

Project Echo is currently on hold, as my full attention is on finding a company willing to support my career transition into tech.
This project was built entirely in my free time – and I’d love to return to it soon.
But before I can shift focus back to personal development, I need the security of knowing a company is open to backing this transition.

For potential employers:
My upskilling is currently funded by the German Federal Employment Agency.
If you’re open to working with me, this funding can directly benefit your team – and free me up to continue growing, both professionally and personally.
